Image I downloaded from internet. <br/>
__Attention!__: For clear program working, in directory image/ should be only __one__ image in __.png__ format, no more.<br/>

If you don't have this python3 libraries:<br/>
`os`<br/>
`glob`<br/>
`PIL`<br/>

Just install it in terminal with commands:<br/>
`$ pip3 install os`<br/>
`$ pip3 install glob`<br/>
`$ pip3 install Pillow`<br/>
<br/>
## Running program <br/>
In terminal go to directory `UnIcon` with command <br/>
`cd path/to/directory/UnIcon/`<br/>
After this, simply run program with command:<br/>
`python3 unicon.py`<br/>

On the next step you see this:<br/>
`Enter icon name: `<br/>
Just write name of icon, you want to create.<br/>

If you see this, it means icon has just been created.<br/>
`Done.`<br/>

So, it's all, icon is located in the same directory `UnIcon`. <br/>
